Readme Instructions:
The project is done on ipython notebook , as it will be easy for visualisation purposes.
It is adviced to execute the ipynb files on Kaggle as they will provide the necessary libraries and it is not necessary to even download lightGBM and XG Boost.
1)The exploratory data analysis part is done in the Data_Analysis.ipynb file and the instructions to execute are straigtforward
2)The main modelling and stacking is done in the main.ipynb file and the necessary results (screenshots)during the execution is attatched, as the runtime is nearly 1 hour for the whole file and takes time to converge.

If you are using the latest Anaconda environment, please download the XG boost and LightGBM libraries using the following commands:
conda install -c conda-forge xgboost 
conda install -c conda-forge lightgbm
